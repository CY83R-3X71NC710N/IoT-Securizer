## Overview

**IoT-Securizer** is a comprehensive security system leveraging AI & ML to protect IoT devices. By constantly scanning for threats and analysing new data traffic, IoT-Securizer offers the most advanced protection for billions of connected devices. Utilizing mathematical algorithms such as entropy & probability, this project can quickly determine if any data leaked is fixed and calculable or not.

## Features

- Trains an AI model using a variety of deep learning & random forest algorithms
- Incorporates mathematical algorithms such as entropy & probability
- Constantly scans for threats and analyzes new data traffic
- Utilizes TensorFlow & Scikit-Learn libraries

## How It Works

IoT-Securizer utilizes deep learning & random forest algorithms to analyse and classify IoT data traffic. These algorithms incorporate mathematical algorithms such as entropy & probability, to accurately determine if any data leaked is fixed and calculable. Once the data traffic is classified, it is then vectorized, forming clusters of related data packets. This data is then processed in complex AI systems, where it is able to identify malicious data packets, alert the user and take preventative action.
